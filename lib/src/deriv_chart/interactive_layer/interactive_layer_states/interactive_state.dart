/// The state of the interactive layer.
///
/// This abstract class defines the interface for different states that the [InteractiveLayer]
/// can be in. It allows the interactive layer to change its behavior dynamically by
/// switching between different states.
///
/// There are three main states implemented:
/// * [InteractiveNormalState]: The default state where no tools are selected or being added
/// * [InteractiveSelectedToolState]: Activated when a tool is selected, enabling manipulation
/// * [InteractiveAddingToolState]: Active when a new tool is being created
///
/// Each state handles user interactions (tap, pan events) differently and can transition
/// to other states using [InteractiveLayerBase.updateStateTo].

  /// to a new state or adding/saving drawings.
